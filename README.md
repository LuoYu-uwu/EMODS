# EMODS
<br>
This project is a multifaceted integration of diverse
functionalities that together form an immersive pet simulation
game. Central to our design is the virtual pet, Loopy. Each team
member contributed a unique component, such as character
customization, feeding, bathing, sleeping, driving, and pizza
making. This collective effort requires coordination to maintain a
unified theme, optimise resource usage, and ensure
seamless transitions between game states.
<br>
Given the graphics-intensive nature of our game, efficient
use of Look-Up-Tables (LUT) and Block RAM (BRAM) was
critical, ensuring that animations and transitions were not only
smooth but also memory efficient, combining individual
functionalities into a cohesive and engaging game
